Indicate where your data comes from
Include instructions for loading your data from the command-line in MySQL
Include instruction for running your Python program (e.g. if command-line arguments are supported, indicate what those are)
If any files are written to the user's system, you should also indicate this
You may guinea pig your README with a friend (without showing your source code) to ensure that it is clear enough to get started without looking into your project
If there are any unfinished features, indicate this in your README so that we know some incomplete functionality is intended to prevent possible deductions (assuming you follow the rest of the requirements)
