                <h4></h4>
                <p>A course on computer programming emphasizing the program design process 
                    and pragmatic programming skills. It will use the Python programming language 
                    and will not assume previous programming experience. Material covered will 
                    include data types, variables, assignment, control structures, functions, 
                    scoping, compound data, string processing, modules, basic input/output 
                    (terminal and file), as well as more advanced topics such as recursion, 
                    exception handling and object-oriented programming. Program development 
                    and maintenance skills including debugging, testing, and documentation 
                    will also be taught. Assignments will include problems drawn from fields 
                    such as graphics, numerics, networking, and games. At the end of the course, 
                    students will be ready to learn other programming languages in courses 
                    such as CS 11, and will also be ready to take more in-depth courses such 
                    as CS 2 and CS 4.</p>

                <h4>Prerequisites: CS 1 or equivalent.</h4>
                <p>CS 2 is a demanding course in programming languages and computer science. 
                    Topics covered include data structures, including lists, trees, and graphs; 
                    implementation and performance analysis of fundamental algorithms; algorithm 
                    design principles, in particular recursion and dynamic programming; Heavy emphasis 
                    is placed on the use of compiled languages and development tools, including source 
                    control and debugging. The course includes weekly laboratory exercises and projects 
                    covering the lecture material and program design. The course is intended to establish
                     a foundation for further work in many topics in the computer science option..</p>
